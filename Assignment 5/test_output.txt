In BSTRefBased.java, I have six tests to confirm that the functions work as specified by the assignment.

Test 1 and 2 both test insert (by Dr. Zastre).

Test 3 calls retrieve() and confirms that the it correctly returns a WordRefs object with containing the expected String.

Test 4 calls retrieve() and confirms that it works even in trees with different amounts of nodes.

Test 5 calls delete() and confirms that the deleted object is no longer in the tree by checking that calling retrieve returns null.

Test 6 calls delete() and confirms that calling it with a string that is not in the tree does not affect the tree in any way.



Dr. Zastre also included several tests (in01.txt, out01.txt, etc.) for further testing. My implementation passes all his tests.

As for extra work, I implemented an alternate version of BSTIterator and WordRefs so that the tree uses integers rather than Strings, thus it can be used to sort numbers.
