Extra work:

I have completed the assignment to the specifications given. All the required files are included in the base Assignment 1 folder.

I have also gone above the requirements and played with some assumptions in the assignment specifications for an A grade.

In the folder labeled Extra, I have included modified versions of the files. The assignment says to assume that input messages are all lowercase characters only, but I changed my ensure that the user cannot break this rule.
To do this, I implemented a custom exception, which is thrown if the input message is not only lowercase characters.

I believe my extra work is worthy of an A grade.


Test information:


In CipherTester.java, "Test Encrypt" defines a test input string "themessage" as well as a string of what we would expect it to be encrypted as based on the assignment instructions ("uvfnsttohf").

It then tries calls the encrypt method and compares with the test input string as an argument and confirms that the returned value is the same as the expected encrypted string.

After that it prints whether or not the test passed.



"Test Decrypt" defines a test input encrypted string "uvfnsttohf" as well as a string of what we would expect it to be decrypted as, which is the same as the input for test encrypt ("themessage").

It then tries calls the encrypt method and compares with the test input string as an argument and confirms that the returned value is the same as the expected encrypted string.

After that it prints whether or not the test passed.



Before I wrote tests for the encrypt and decrypt methods, I wrote tests for the stringToIntArray and intArrayToString methods, which work in essentially the same way. They define expected input and output and compare the actual output to the expected output. I have commented out these tests because these tests only work if those methods are public, but the assignment specifies that they be private.
